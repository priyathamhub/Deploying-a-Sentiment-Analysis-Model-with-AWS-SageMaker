# IMDB-SageMaker
In this project, you will construct a recurrent neural network to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. 
I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. Besides, I deploy my model and construct a simple web app that will interact with the deployed model.
